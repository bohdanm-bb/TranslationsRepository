When I finish university I want to do lots of things! I am going to travel abroad to spend some time in France. I want to improve my French and I think I will improve if I spend a few months living in a small town in the South of France. I am going to practice guitar every day because I wonâ€™t have to study every day. It is going to be so great! I am going to go to the beach every morning and swim in the sea. I am going to spend a lot of money there but I think I will be okay. It is going to be so great!
